This repository features three JavaScript projects: a Tetris game, a calculator, and a to-do list application. Each project highlights my practical knowledge in JavaScript, modern web development concepts, and DOM manipulation to create interactive, user-friendly applications.

JavaScript Tetris Game

Dynamic Gameplay and Scoring: A fully interactive Tetris game with real-time block controls, scoring, and progression that simulates the original Tetris experience.
DOM Manipulation for Live Updates: Uses JavaScript to dynamically render block movements, rotations, and row-clearing, updating the game board in real-time for a smooth player experience.
Core Game Mechanics: Implements essential Tetris rules such as collision detection, line clearing, and game-over conditions, all organized within a modular code structure for clarity and scalability.

 JavaScript Calculator

Core JavaScript Logic and Operations: This calculator covers basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) with clean, concise JavaScript functions and efficient event handling.
DOM Interaction for Real-Time Display: Includes interactive buttons and a display that updates with each input, ensuring calculations are shown and updated instantly as the user enters numbers or operations.
Responsive User Interface: Designed with a responsive layout that adjusts for different screen sizes, maintaining an intuitive and visually pleasing experience across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

JavaScript To-Do List Application

Efficient Task Management: Enables users to add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed, helping track daily tasks and improve productivity.
DOM Manipulation for List Management: Tasks are dynamically added to the DOM, providing immediate visual feedback with color-coded indicators for active and completed tasks.
JavaScript Data Handling: Utilizes JavaScript arrays to store, render, and update tasks, with functions to manipulate task states easily for an organized and interactive user experience.
